# beancount: Double-Entry Accounting from Text Files

## Description

A double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial
transaction records in a text file, read them in memory, generate a variety of
reports from them, and provides a web interface.


## Documentation

There's a [mailing-list dedicated to Beancount](
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beancount), please post questions
there, so others can share in the responses. More general discussions about
command-line accounting also occur on the [Ledger mailing-list](
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ledger-cli) so you might be
interested in that group as well.

## Versions

There are three versions

- **Version 3** ([branch v3](http://github.com/beancount/beancount/tree/v3)):
  The current stable version of Beancount since June 2024. Use this. Note that
  this version is trimmed down from v2 and most of the tools the v2 branch
  included have been moved to their own independent projects on Github.

- **Version 2** ([branch v2](http://github.com/beancount/beancount/tree/v2)):
  The current stable version of Beancount, in maintenance mode as of July 2020.
  This was a complete rewrite of the first version, which introduced a number of
  constraints and a new grammar and much more. Use this now.

- **Version 1** ([branch v1](http://github.com/beancount/beancount/tree/v1)):
  The original version of Beancount. Development on this version halted in 2013.
  This initial version was intended to be similar to and partially compatible
  with Ledger. Do not use this.
